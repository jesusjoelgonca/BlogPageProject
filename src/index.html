            <span class="italic font-bold text-blue-500"
              >powerful CSS framework </span
            >that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to
            quickly and easily style HTML elements. The framework is designed to

          <p>
            One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
            consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
            can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
            ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
            <span class="font-bold">
              easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of such utility classes includes the
            <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to
            center align text, while the
            <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to
            add a light gray background color to an element.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-200 text-black">
            Overall, Tailwind CSS is a great choice for developers looking for a
            powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes consistency in
            design and makes it easy to create responsive designs.
